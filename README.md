# Lingress

A simple lossless compression tool efficient for compressing text in the English language. It uses [Huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) based on a list of words and their approximate frequency. The list used is derived from [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/english-word-frequency/data) dataset.
